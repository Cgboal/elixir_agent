A quick note: This software lives inside of other software. It is relied upon to monitor critical services.

Because of these unique conditions, our standards for code quality must be high!

* Tests are required!
* Performance really matters!
* Features that are specific to just your app are unlikely to make it in
* Instrumentation particular to a library or framework are probably a better fit for their own package which depends on this Agent.
