<!--
Thanks for your interest in the Elixir Agent

A quick note: This is an open source project, not a New Relic product.

* We want to improve and grow the Agent in ways that can benefit the majority of users
* Features that are specific to just one app are unlikely to make it in
* Instrumentation particular to a library or framework are probably a better fit for their own package which depends on this Agent
